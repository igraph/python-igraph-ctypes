Writes the graph in the NCOL format to an output stream.

The NCOL format is essentially a two- or three-column named edge list format.
Each line in the output corresponds to an edge. The first two columns contain
the names of the source and target vertices of an edge. THe third column
(if exists) contains the weight of each edge.

Note that the file format does not store whether the graph is directed or not;
this information has to be supplied when the graph is read back.

Parameters:
    graph: the graph to write
{% include '_include/write_graph_outstream.txt' %}
{% include '_include/write_graph_names.txt' %}
{% include '_include/write_graph_weights.txt' %}
