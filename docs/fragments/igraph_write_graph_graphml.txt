The GraphML format preserves numeric, string and boolean attributes.

Parameters:
    graph: the graph to write
    outstream: the output file or stream to write the graph to. May be a
        filename, a path-like object or a file-like object if it is backed
        by a low-level file handle
    prefixattr: whether to put a prefix in front of the attribute names to
        ensure uniqueness if the graph has vertex and edge (or graph)
        attributes with the same name
