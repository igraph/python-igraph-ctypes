Writes the graph in plain edge list format to an output stream.

THe plain edge list format records the structure of the graph _only_ and the
vertices of the graph will be referred to as numeric vertex IDs instead of
vertex names.

See `write_graph_ncol()` if you have vertex names and you want to use them
in the output file instead of IDs.

Parameters:
    graph: the graph to write
{% include '_include/write_graph_outstream.txt' %}
