Writes the graph in plain edge list format to an output stream.

THe plain edge list format records the structure of the graph _only_ and the
vertices of the graph will be referred to as numeric vertex IDs instead of
vertex names.

See `write_graph_ncol()` if you have vertex names and you want to use them
in the output file instead of IDs.

Parameters:
    graph: the graph to write
    outstream: the output file or stream to write the graph to. May be a
        filename, a path-like object or a file-like object if it is backed
        by a low-level file handle
