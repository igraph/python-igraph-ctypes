Writes the graph in the LGL (Large Graph Layout) format to an output stream.

The LGL format can store the structure of a graph with named vertices and
weighted edges.

Note that the file format does not store whether the graph is directed or not;
this information has to be supplied when the graph is read back.

Parameters:
    graph: the graph to write
{% include '_include/write_graph_outstream.txt' %}
{% include '_include/write_graph_names.txt' %}
{% include '_include/write_graph_weights.txt' %}
    isolates: whether to save isolated vertices to the output
